# The Containerization Basics - Docker/Kubernetes

## What is this course about?

This course is dedicated to the way you can use containers in software development.
These days containers are everywhere and you will be using them (if not already).
That's why it's a good idea for anybody working with backend in any way to know 
what containers are about and how they are managed.

## Why all this stuff is important?

Take a moment and read the thought on container from IT "superpowers":

* [Google](https://cloud.google.com/containers)
* [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-defined)
* [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containerization)

## The content

The course will get you acquainted with **Docker** - the most known containerization 
technology out there. You will find out what it is and how to operate it. 

After learning the basics you will be introduced into the world of **Kubernetes** - 
Google-originated containers _orchestrator_, in other words - the tool everybody 
uses these days one way or another to manage containers at scale. And when we say 
_at scale_, we really mean it, like thousands of containers, even millions. You've
got (we hope) some idea about the Docker after reading the articles above. You may
also use [this article](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)
to get some first impression on Kubernetes (or **k8s** as it's called, and if you 
what to know why, just mind the number of letter between **k** and **s**).

Lastly you will learn some base **Helm** knowledge and if you want to know what it
is, then we've got [another great article](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-helm-and-why-you-should-love-it-74bf3d0aafc) 
for you to explore.
