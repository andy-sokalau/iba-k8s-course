# 01. Introduction

## Reference Info

* **Linux Bible**. Chapter 1. _Starting with Linux_
* **Linux Essentials**. Chapter 2. _Linux and Free Software_

Both of this book you can find in the same course. You also can look for more 
information in the Internet.

Use virtual machine or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
to complete the course. The latter might not give you possibility to work on
lower levels (like disks or networking) but is still useful tool. Also WSL2 should 
provide more capabilities but at the time of writing this text it's not yet 
released.
